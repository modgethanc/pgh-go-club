<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>Here are some materials that can be used to promote go and the Pittsburgh Go Association.  Anyone who wishes to help may print them out and distribute them.</p>

<p>Although, all of the materials are specific to the PGA, other clubs are welcome to copy ideas for their own use.</p>

 <dt><a href="material/9x9board.pdf">9x9 Board</a></dt>
  <dd>This printable 9x9 board fits perfectly with the stones from a full size go set.  Its always nice to have a small board on hand for teaching beginners or for playing a quick game.</dd>

<h3>Promotional Materials</h3>

<p>We used to have some signs for promoting meetings, but they are all out date at the moment.  Once they can be updated, they\'ll be posted here again.</p>
<!--
<dl>
 <dt><a href="material/gensign.pdf">General Sign</a></dt>
  <dd>Use this sign to promote the club anywhere in the Pittsburgh area.</dd>
 <dt><a href="material/cmusign.pdf">CMU Sign</a></dt>
  <dd>The meeting info on this sign assumes a familiarity with the CMU campus, so it is best to post it on campus.</dd>
 <dt><a href="material/hikasign.pdf">Hikaru Sign</a></dt>
  <dd>This sign uses images from Hikaru No Go, an anime/manga series about go.  It works best at anime conventions, comic book stores, and other places where anime fans gather.</dd>
