<h2>Links</h2>

<p>There are a great deal of wonderful go resources on the web.  Here are a handful that members of the Pittsburgh Go Association often reccomend.</p>

<p><b>Websites</b></p>
<dl>

<dt><a href="//www.gokgs.com/">KGS</a> - The most popular go server in the western hemisphere</dt>

<dt><a href="//senseis.xmp.net">Sensei\'s Library</a> - Wikipedia of Go</dt>

<dt><a href="//gogameguru.com">GoGameGuru</a> - Great resource for news and problems (they also have English subtitled Baduk TV for purchase)</dt>


</dl>
<br>
<p><b>Mobile Apps</b></p>

For Android, I like <a href="//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.lrstudios.android.tsumego_workshop">Tsumego Pro</a> and the <a href="//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wbaduk&hl=en">WBaduk</a> app, which are both free. But there are many more. And for iPhone/iPad there are even better options, especially if you are willing to pay. You should definitely check them out; go apps are a great way to casually improve.
